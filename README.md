Robosense Package
===================

This gives the ability to use the Robosense Lidars from the bare API (no ROS or other middleware)

It uses: boost and pcap, thus you should install pcap with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y  libpcap-dev
git clone git@github.com:TheKobiThirdparty/robosense.git
```

The rs_driver is available in [TheKobiThirdparty/rs_driver](http://github.com/TheKobiThirdparty/rs_driver).
